# XMT_forgotten_items_prediction
Framework for predicting forgotten items in retail environments using interpretable machine learning. 

Introduces the XMT and TXMT methods that combine multiple evidence types to identify potentially forgotten items, with emphasis on explainable predictions.

In this repository, you can find my implementations for these methods as well as the code used in the various experiments of in my Master's Degree Thesis.
